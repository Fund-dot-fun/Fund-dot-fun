# Welcome to GoFundingdotFun!

1\. Abstract\
Funddotfun is a decentralized token launcher platform that enables anyone to tokenize and crowdfund scholarships, research, startups, and creative projects through blockchain on EduChain. With gamified milestones, deployer incentives, and direct peer-to-peer donation features, Funddotfun empowers fundraisers to launch funding tokens quickly while ensuring transparency, security, and scalability.\
2\. Problem Statement\
Current crowdfunding platforms suffer from centralized gatekeeping, high fees, limited automation, and lack of transparency. Many educational and research initiatives struggle to gain funding due to platform limitations or strict policies. Web3 introduces new possibilities with onchain fundraising, tokenization, and programmable rewards.\
3\. Solution\
Funddotfun provides a permissionless platform where users can:\
Instantly deploy a funding token with fixed tokenomics\
Receive 2% deployer allocation (with vesting)\
Accept direct donations via wallet integration\
Earn fee revenue from early market participation\
Monitor growth with market cap-based milestones\
4\. Platform Architecture\
Frontend: Built with React & Tailwind\
Backend: Node.js with database for metadata\
Smart Contracts: ERC-20 compatible (Solidity via Foundry)\
Chain: EduChain (EVM-compatible)\
Storage: IPFS for images & metadata\
5\. Tokenomics\
Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 (Fixed)\
Deployer Allocation: 2% (Vesting-based)\
Token Standard: ERC-20 (EduChain)\
Initial Buy-in: Optional starting liquidity\
Ticker & Name: Custom input at token creation\
6\. Vesting Mechanism\
\
If none of the milestones are reached within 6 months, unvested tokens are automatically burned.\
7\. Fee Structure\
Token Creation Fee: Fixed (e.g., 100 EDU)\
Swap Fee: 1.5% per transaction\
0.75% to Deployer (until bonding cap)\
0.75% to Platform\
Bonding Graduation:\
When token MC reaches $50,000:\
Platform receives $1,000 from LP\
Deployer fee sharing ends\
Swap becomes fully onchain\
8\. Key Features\
Create Funding Token: Through an easy-to-use interface\
Donate Me Button: Manual wallet input for direct donations\
Token Market: Public list of active fundraising tokens\
Milestone Vesting: Encourages real growth & participation\
Burn Safety: Prevents token hoarding or failure without accountability\
