# 👋 Welcome to GoFundingdotFun

![GoFund dot Fun](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d17cc026-080e-4b67-b665-ae06c4e7a96e)

## 1. Abstract  

**Gofundingdotfun** is a decentralized token launcher that empowers users to tokenize and crowdfund scholarships, research, startups, and creative projects on **EduChain**. Featuring gamified milestones, deployer incentives, and peer-to-peer donations, it offers a transparent, secure, and scalable way to raise funds onchain.

## 2. Problem Statement  

Traditional crowdfunding platforms are plagued by:

- Centralized gatekeeping  
- High fees  
- Lack of transparency  
- Limited automation  

Many innovative educational and research initiatives go unfunded due to these platform limitations. Web3 opens up possibilities for onchain fundraising, tokenization, and programmable rewards.

## 3. Our Solution  

**Funddotfun** offers a permissionless platform to:

- Instantly deploy funding tokens with fixed tokenomics  
- Receive 2% deployer allocation (with vesting)  
- Accept direct donations via wallet integration  
- Earn fee revenue from early market activity  
- Track growth with milestone-based rewards  

## 4. Platform Architecture  

- **Frontend:** Remix React [React Router x Vite], WAGMI, Viem, Tailwind, ShadCN, framer-motion and GSAP
- **Backend:** Express, MongoDB
- **Smart Contracts:** ERC-20 via Solidity (Foundry)  
- **Blockchain:** EduChain Test Network (EVM-compatible)  
- **Storage:** IPFS (Pinata) for images & metadata  

## 5. Tokenomics  

- **Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 (Fixed)  
- **Deployer Allocation:** 2% (vesting-based)  
- **Token Standard:** ERC-20 on EduChain  
- **Initial Liquidity:** Optional at launch  
- **Ticker & Name:** Customizable at token creation  

## 6. Vesting Mechanism  

If no milestones are reached within 6 months, all **unvested tokens will be burned** to ensure accountability.

## 7. Fee Structure  

- **Token Creation Fee:** 0.003 EDU
- **Swap Fee per Transaction:** 1.5%  
  - 0.75% to Deployer (until bonding cap)  
  - 0.75% to Platform  

**Bonding Graduation:**  
When token market cap reaches **$50,000**:  

- Platform receives $1,000 from LP  
- Deployer fee sharing ends  
- Swaps become fully onchain  

## 8. Key Features  

- ✅ **Create Funding Token** – Simple UI for instant token launch  
- 💸 **Donate Me Button** – Manual wallet input for direct P2P support  
- 📈 **Token Market** – Browse and support live fundraising tokens  
- 🎯 **Milestone Vesting** – Encourages real growth & progress  
- 🔥 **Burn Safety** – Prevents hoarding or stagnation
