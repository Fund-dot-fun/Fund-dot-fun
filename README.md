 What is GoFunding-dot-fun?
GoFunding-dot-fun is a Web3 crowdfunding platform on EduChain that lets users launch fundraising tokens for scholarships, research, and startupsâ€”no coding required. Each token is instantly tradable, with gamified milestones, incentives, and full transparency.

Users can explore or create tokens, connect their wallet, and start raising funds. Tokens have a fixed supply, vesting based on market cap, and are listed with real-time metrics. A 1.5% trading fee sustains the platform, with rewards and liquidity boosts for successful projects. Tokens failing after 6 months are auto-burned to reduce spam.

Why GoFunding-dot-fun?
GoFunding-dot-fun empowers education through tokenized crowdfunding, blending Web3 tools with real impact, transparency, and performance-based rewards.
